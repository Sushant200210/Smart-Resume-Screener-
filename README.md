🚀 Smart-Resume-Screener
An AI-powered Python tool that intelligently compares resumes with job descriptions to assess their compatibility. It uses BERT-based embeddings from the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model to compute semantic similarity, enabling smarter and more context-aware matching than simple keyword search.

🔍 Features
✅ Compare text-based resumes and job descriptions.

✅ Uses BERT via sentence-transformers for state-of-the-art semantic embeddings.

✅ Computes cosine similarity for robust matching.

✅ Lightweight and minimal implementation – easy to use and extend.

✅ Perfect for HR tech tools, ATS systems, and personal resume analysis.

🧠 How It Works
BERT Embeddings: The model all-MiniLM-L6-v2 converts input texts (resume & JD) into dense vector representations (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning.

Cosine Similarity: Measures the angle between the two embeddings in vector space – the closer they are, the more semantically similar the resume is to the JD.
